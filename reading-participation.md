## Readings
All of our course readings are available online or through our class Google drive folder. I expect you to come to class having completed all of the assigned reading for that day.

## Attendance and Active Participation
As with any graduate course, you are expected to do the reading for, attend, and actively participate in every class period, barring emergencies or illness. If you are someone for whom participation in class is difficult, please talk to me about strategies for increasing your participation. If you know you will miss a particular class period, please let me know in advance. In case this needs to be said: Obviously, assuming we move to in-person instruction after the first two weeks of the semester, I do not want you to come to class if you feel sick, if you are experiencing even mild cold- or flu-like symptoms, if you have been in contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, or if you test positive for COVID-19. Just stay home, take care of yourself, and do not run the risk of infecting others. If you find that you are ill or will have to quarantine for an extended period (i.e., more than 1 class), please talk to me and we will come up with a way to catch you up. Your grade will not be negatively affected due to illness or quarantine.
