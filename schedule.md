Readings are either linked below or located in our course Google drive folder (in the “Course Readings” subfolder). Readings are due -- meaning they should be completed -- on the dates indicated.

The most accurate and up-to-date version of this calendar can be found on this site. Use this version to check on reading assignments, rather than the printed version of the syllabus, since the print version will not be updated throughout the semester.

I reserve the right to change the course calendar as needed; adequate advance notice will always be given of any changes.

You should also read through the "Why Voyant?" section, and complete steps 1-3 (downloading the corpora, creating a notes document, uploading the corpora to Voyant (and saving the science corpus ID), and saving the humanities corpus browser link). Uploading the corpora to Voyant and saving the corpus IDs and URLs is potentially one of the more fiddly aspects of working with Voyant, but it will save us a lot of time in class. I will be in the room 30 minutes before our class on this date; if you are available and would like to walk through the uploading with me, please feel free to come early.
