title: Additional Reading

Here you will find additional readings that there wasn’t space for on the course syllabus. You may use these readings when conducting research for your lab notebook entries and/or final project; you may also use one of the below readings as your proposed reading for week 11 (if appropriate). Those readings not available online are included in the “Additional Reading” folder in our class Google drive folder (unless they are books). The readings are roughly organized by theme.
